Chess Notation or Algebraic Chess Notation is a way of writing moves on a chessboard, where the rows and columns of the board are as so:

  A B C D E F G H
8 ♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♗ ♘ ♖ 8
7 ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ 7
6                 6
5                 5
4                 4
3                 3
2 ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ 2
1 ♜ ♞ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♞ ♜ 1
  A B C D E F G H

For example, the move
1. e4
(Or the Pawn on e2 moves to e4)
is written as
pe2e4 in Algebraic Chess Notation (At least, that's how this program recognizes it.)
